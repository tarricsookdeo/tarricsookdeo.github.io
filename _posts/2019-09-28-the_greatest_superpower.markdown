Many people view the ability to write computer code as a skill. I think this is a grave understatement. I believe the ability to speak to and instruct a computer via code is nothing short of a superpower. Writing good code is like putting together a symphony. The individual components in the code don't seem to do much on their own, similar to the individual members of an orchestra. However, use those code components together, and great things can come out of the most unexpected places (mostly garages).

Even more powerful than good code is code with a purpose. One of my favorite quotes about technology comes from the AMC show Halt and Catch Fire. A character named Joe said "Technology isn't the thing. It's the thing that gets us to the thing." What Joe meant by this is that computers don't have an intrinsic worth. They're just a hunk of beautifully engineered hardware. Plastic, and metal. We don't just develop technology for the sake of making it faster, and better for fun. Technology leads us to something greater when we give it a purpose. Facebook didn't become a large corporation by just making better and faster products with more features. Facebook has a mission to connect as many people around the world as it can. Facebook is the technology aspect of it, but the "thing" that Joe was talking about is the ability to connect people in a way that was inconceivable a few decades ago. This logic can be applied to many companies and products that use technology and coding as their means to pursue their mission. When code has a purpose, it can change the world, and improve lives.

I believe we are at the beginning of a new era of computing. Cloud computing is continuing to grow at an exponential pace, advances in machine learning are being made as we generate more to analyze, and computers are getting cheaper and into more hands than ever before. Technology will be a driving force in helping the poorest people in the world get out of crippling poverty. Technology will help us better understand our own bodies and develop medicines. It will help us explore worlds that seemed so distant in the not so distant past. Knowing how to code is a modern superpower. Those who possess this superpower will directly be involved in the shaping of mankind's future.
