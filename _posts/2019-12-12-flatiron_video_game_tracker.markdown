The second project I completed is a Sinatra web app. The app is a video game tracker where users can create, read, update, and delete video games in their inventory. In this blog post, I will talk about some of the challenges I faced, things I've learned, and what future work I have planned for the project.

#### Active Record Relationships

One of the challenges I faced in this project is understanding how Active Record relationships worked. I found this artice which helped a lot https://guides.rubyonrails.org/association_basics.html. During the first iteration of my project, I was searching all the games in the database, and finding the ones that belonged to a specific user.

## Future Work

The current state of the application is very basic and doesn't have much functionality. However, with more time, more features can be added. The following is a list of a few that I hope to add in the coming weeks.

### Filter by 

Something I would love to add is the ability to filter the viewed games based on publishers, and ratings.

### Reorder
Another cool feature I would like to add is the ability for the user to reorder games. It can be in alphabetical order, or some other order.
